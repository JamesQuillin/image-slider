# Image Slider
A simple, lightweight, and responsive image slideshow made with vanilla CSS and JS.

To run just download and open the html sample page in a browser. To use just add the appropriate classes and IDs to your markup like with the sample (.image-slider and #slider-button-left / #slider-button-right) and remember to set your images to display as 'none' by default initially (this is taken care of in the inline style tag in the sample html page).
